# Java 23 Features Demo ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Java 23 Features Demo** repository! This project showcases the latest enhancements in Java 23, including updates in concurrency, I/O methods, streams, and more. The code examples here are designed to help you understand and implement these new features in your projects.

## Features

This repository covers several new features introduced in **Java 23**, including:

1. **Enhanced Print and Read I/O Methods**  
   Learn how to use the new `print()`, `println()`, and `readLn()` methods for simpler and more efficient I/O operations.

2. **Stream Gatherers API**  
   Leverage the new Stream Gatherers API for advanced stream processing, making it easier to manipulate collections and streams.

3. **Implicitly Declared Classes & Instance Main Methods**  
   Discover how implicitly declared classes and instance-based `main` methods streamline your coding experience.

4. **Structured Concurrency**  
   Manage parallel tasks with ease using the `StructuredTaskScope` API. This demo illustrates how structured concurrency improves error handling and task management.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- **Java 23** (Ensure you have the latest version installed)  
- **Maven/Gradle** (Optional for dependency management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java23features.git
   cd java23features
   ```

2. Compile and run the examples:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   java src/Main
   ```

   Alternatively, if you use Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn compile exec:java
   ```

## Usage

This repository is organized into different examples for each Java 23 feature:

- Navigate to the `src/` directory to find individual classes demonstrating the features.
- Each class has a `main` method that you can run to see the output.
- Detailed comments are provided in each file to explain how the new features work.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how you can run the **Structured Concurrency** example:

```bash
javac src/StructuredConcurrencyExample.java
